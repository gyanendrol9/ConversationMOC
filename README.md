## ConversationMoC: Encoding Conversational Dynamics using Multiplex Network for Identifying Moment of Change in Mood and Mental Health Classification
This work introduces a unique conversation-level dataset and investigates the impact of conversational context in detecting Moments of Change (MoC) in individual emotions and classifying Mental Health (MH) topics in discourse. In this study, we differentiate between analyzing individual posts and studying entire conversations, using sequential and graph-based models to encode the complex conversation dynamics. Further, we incorporate emotion and sentiment dynamics with social interactions using a graph multiplex model driven by Graph Convolution Networks (GCN). Comparative evaluations consistently highlight the enhanced performance of the multiplex network, especially when combining *reply*, *emotion*, and *sentiment* network layers. This underscores the importance of understanding the intricate interplay between social interactions, emotional expressions, and sentiment patterns in conversations, especially within online mental health discussions.

+ Install the following pre-requisite Python3.8 libraries:
```
pip install transformers==4.20.1
pip install tensorflow==2.9.1
pip install keras==2.9.0
pip install networkx
pip install stellargraph==1.2.1
pip install sklearn==1.1.1
pip install sentence-transformers==2.2.0

## Preparing Data set
For a conversation *idx*
```
| Column 1  | Column 2  | Column 3  |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Row 1 Col 1 | Row 1 Col 2 | Row 1 Col 3 |
| Row 2 Col 1 | Row 2 Col 2 | Row 2 Col 3 |

| Data     | Information | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
|timeline_pids[idx] | Sequence of pids in the conversation *idx* | [*pid_1*, *pid_2*, *pid_3*, *pid_4*, ...,*pid_n*]|
|timeline_node_feat_seq[idx] | Representation matrix of posts in the conversation *idx*  |Matrix shape: (n posts, emb dimension)|
|timeline_node_moc_seq[idx] | MoC annotated labels  | ['O', ' ', ' ', 'IS', ..., 'O']|
|timeline_network[idx] | Reply adjacency matrix of the conversation *idx* |Matrix shape: (n x n)|
|timeline_users_flag[idx] | Boolean flag of the sequence of pids in a conversation *idx* as target user or not  |[*True*, *False*, *False*, *True*, ..., *True*]|
|timeline_topics[idx] | Topic of the conversation *idx* | *Schizophrenia*|
```

, prepare the

timeline_node_moc_seq[idx] - MoC annotated labels wrt the sequence of pids in the conversation 'idx'
timeline_network[idx] - Reply adjacency matrix of the conversation 'idx'
timeline_users_flag[idx] - Boolean flag of the sequence of pids in a conversation 'idx' as target user or not 
timeline_topics[idx] - Topic of the conversation 'idx'
