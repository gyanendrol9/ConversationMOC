## ConversationMoC: Encoding Conversational Dynamics using Multiplex Network for Identifying Moment of Change in Mood and Mental Health Classification
This work introduces a unique conversation-level dataset and investigates the impact of conversational context in detecting Moments of Change (MoC) in individual emotions and classifying Mental Health (MH) topics in discourse. In this study, we differentiate between analyzing individual posts and studying entire conversations, using sequential and graph-based models to encode the complex conversation dynamics. Further, we incorporate emotion and sentiment dynamics with social interactions using a graph multiplex model driven by Graph Convolution Networks (GCN). Comparative evaluations consistently highlight the enhanced performance of the multiplex network, especially when combining *reply*, *emotion*, and *sentiment* network layers. This underscores the importance of understanding the intricate interplay between social interactions, emotional expressions, and sentiment patterns in conversations, especially within online mental health discussions.

    abstract = "This work describes the classification system proposed for the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) Shared Task 2022. We propose the use of multitask learning approach with bidirectional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) model for predicting changes in user{'}s mood and their suicidal risk level. The two classification tasks have been solved independently or in an augmented way previously, where the output of one task is leveraged for learning another task, however this work proposes an {`}all-in-one{'} framework that jointly learns the related mental health tasks. The experimental results suggest that the proposed multi-task framework outperforms the remaining single-task frameworks submitted to the challenge and evaluated via timeline based and coverage based performance metrics shared by the organisers. We also assess the potential of using various types of feature embedding schemes that could prove useful in initialising the Bi-LSTM model for better multitask learning in the mental health domain.",
